# Planned work

This page tracks requested work and completed milestones. For current controls, use the [user guide](../README.md).

## Combine movement and color cycling — implemented

- [x] Choose movement and color effects independently, including color-only animation.
- [x] Move glyphs and their cell colors, then calculate animated inks at destination positions.
- [x] Share one loop duration and frame calculation across preview, GIF, video, PNG frame ZIP, and C64 programs.
- [x] Preserve source artwork, replay, project settings, and history.
- [x] Test all nine movement/color combinations and exported pixels.

## Shape animation effects — implemented

- [x] Scroll left, right, up, or down with explicit direction controls.
- [x] Set movement-wave and color-wave directions independently.
- [x] Choose sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, or reverse sawtooth for each wave.
- [x] Set independent movement/color rates of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 cycles inside an overall loop duration.
- [x] Keep cycle boundaries aligned across preview and every output; warn for undersampled combinations.
- [x] Keep controls contextual and share saved settings across preview and downloads.

## Run artwork on a C64 — first player implemented

- [x] Export a runnable still-picture PRG with both character sets and per-cell colors.
- [x] Play sampled replay, color cycling, movement, inverse effects, and combinations using compressed changed runs.
- [x] Support continuous playback, 1–100 repetitions, and RUN/STOP exit.
- [x] Check geometry, memory budget, estimated playback work, and actual 6502 CPU execution.
- [ ] Verify in full VICE emulation and on physical PAL/NTSC C64 hardware.
- [ ] Evaluate raster-synchronized updates, procedural native effects, and optional D64 packaging.

See the [C64 output guide](c64-output.md) for loading instructions, timing, memory limits, and verification scope.

## C64-only editor — implemented

- [x] Remove legacy approximate shapes, their renderers and stencil checker, v1 projects, Unicode/mixed text imports, and obsolete single-effect color settings. Keep the authentic C64 editor and current numeric v2 projects intact.

The [UI review](ui-review.md#follow-ups-to-evaluate) tracks layout experiments. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#future-features-to-explore) lists other possible editing features.
